# Day 01: Build a Simple Text-to-Email Automation

## 🧠 Goal
Create a basic automation that takes a message from a text input and sends it to your email.

## 🧰 Tools
- Make.com or Zapier (or just pseudocode for now)
- Python (optional)

## ⚙️ Logic Flow
1. Trigger: Manual webhook or button press
2. Input: Custom message text
3. Action: Send that message to your email address

## 🏁 Stretch Goal
Make it read from a `.txt` file and email the contents using Python (with `smtplib`).

## 📝 Notes
Keep it simple! Just getting used to writing and storing your logic is the first win.
